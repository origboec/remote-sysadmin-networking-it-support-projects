# ðŸ“˜ Lesson 1: Introduction to System Administration and IT Support

## âœ… What I Learned

- System Administration involves maintaining and securing computer systems, especially servers, networks, and OS.
- A System Administrator ensures uptime, security, and troubleshooting on the backend.
- IT Support helps users solve software and hardware problems.
- The key difference is that SysAdmins manage systems behind the scenes, while IT Support works directly with end users.

## ðŸ›  My Reflections

This lesson gave me a clear picture of what System Administration and IT Support involve. I now understand the difference between helping users (IT Support) and managing the whole infrastructure (System Admin).

I'm beginning to see why command line tools and remote access are so important in this field.
