# ðŸ“˜ Lesson 1: Introduction to System Administration, Networking, and IT Support

## âœ… What I Learned

- **System Administration** involves maintaining and securing computer systems â€” including servers, user accounts, operating systems, and networks.
- A **System Administrator** ensures systems are running, secure, updated, and troubleshoot backend issues quickly.
- **Networking** is a major part of system administration, dealing with how computers communicate over LAN, WAN, and the internet.
- A **Network Administrator** manages routers, switches, IP addressing, firewalls, DNS, DHCP, and ensures data flows smoothly across systems.
- **IT Support** helps users solve issues with devices, software, login credentials, and other front-end user problems.
- The key difference is:
  - **SysAdmins** focus on backend systems.
  - **Network Admins** focus on connectivity and infrastructure.
  - **IT Support** focuses on helping users interact with systems effectively.

## ðŸ›  My Reflections

This lesson gave me a clear picture of what System Administration, Networking, and IT Support involve. I now understand how these roles connect and support each other.

- The **System Administrator** manages the servers and keeps everything running.
- The **Network Administrator** ensures the systems can talk to each other.
- The **IT Support Specialist** helps the users interact with the system smoothly.

I'm beginning to see why **command-line tools, remote access, and network configurations** are so important in this field. Theyâ€™re the backbone of effective IT operations â€” especially in remote and enterprise environments.
